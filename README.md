# Horiseon Code Refactor

This was a project I particitpated in to refactor some legacy markup  from the client's website.  They had asked for some updates to the HTML to improve the website for accessibility.  While working on this, I also encountered a few other items within the HTML and CSS that would improve the efficiency and sustainability of their site which I updated.
