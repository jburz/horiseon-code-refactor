# Horiseon Code Refactor ![Top Language Badge](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/jburz/horiseon-code-refactor)

This was a project I particitpated in to refactor some legacy markup from the Horiseon's website.  They had asked for some updates to the HTML to improve the website for accessibility.  While working on this, I also encountered a few other items within the HTML and CSS that would improve the efficiency and sustainability of their site which I updated.
